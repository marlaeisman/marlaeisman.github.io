## About Me

I recieved my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Florida (UF) in December 2024. During my undergraduate education, I was the Lead Engineer at Gator Motorsports, a researcher in UFâ€™s Nonlinear Controls and Robotics Lab and the Cognition, Action, and Perception of Speech Lab, and completed internships at SpaceX and Tesla. I also volunteered with the Society of Women Engineers and Haven Hospice. I am specifically interested in using nonlinear control theory and real-time machine learning to enhance adaptive and robust systems and applying these frameworks to real-world challenges in unpredictable environments. I am currently applying to PhD programs to expand this research. Take a look at my recent projects:
