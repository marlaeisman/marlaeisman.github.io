## Portfolio
###

I am a graduating senior mechanical engineer from the University of Florida. I am currently applying to PhD programs planning to research nonlinear controls, deep learning, and multi-agent systems. Take a look at my recent research projects:

### Original Residual Neural Networks (RNN)

I conducted an in-depth residual neural network architectural analysis to understand the effect of bias, neural depth, activation functions, and gains on system performance for double pendulum dynamics.  Based on the system’s results, I derived
original mathematical improvements to deep residual neural networks and proved the precise correspondence between the simulation and theoretical predictions.
    
### Herding Simulation with Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

  </div>
I developed a herding model and experiment using DNNs to study coordination in multi-agent systems. I focused on applying adaptive, deep learning techniques, aimed at cooperative control in complex, dynamic environments.

### Multi-Agent Tracking Simulation with Outdoor Experiment using DNN

I designed and executed a multi-agent tracking simulation complemented by an outdoor experiment, leveraging Deep Neural Networks. I implemented a residual neural network architecture for real-time target tracking in dynamic settings using IMU and GPS data through ROS 2.

### Electric Vehicle (EV) Design with Gator Motorsports

As soon as I arrived at UF, I joined the Formula SAE racing design team, Gator Motorsports, which
designs, builds, and manufactures a Formula-style race car every year. I realized the team’s internal
combustion vehicle lacked the performance and innovation of an electric vehicle (EV) powertrain. As a
freshman, I became Lead EV Engineer, dedicating over 40 hours per week for three years to research and
develop UF’s first-ever electric racecar. I designed a lap dynamics program in MATLAB to simulate the
race track with high-order dynamics including regenerative braking. Based on the program’s predicted
energy distribution and battery geometry, I designed a custom 400-volt lithium-ion powertrain and
robust cooling system to efficiently power the vehicle and maintain safe battery temperatures. I supported
the combustion team in parallel, where we personally manufactured over 90% of our vehicle components
through manual/CNC machining and carbon fiber fabrication. In 2022, our vehicle achieved the fastest
acceleration in the SAE competition and ranked 3rd out of 100 teams worldwide.

In my third year with Gator Motorsports, I led the team as Vice President after university budget
cuts eliminated 100% of our funding. I led 30 members to contact over 250 potential sponsors and
completely fulfill our $70,000 budget, ensuring that we could compete. My leadership developed the global
partnership and public engagement skills of my team members, better equipping them to enter the STEM
workforce. My outreach attracted media attention, where I seized the opportunity to engage the public on
STEM education and sustainable engineering solutions. I used my vehicle development research to
highlight the pivotal role of EV technologies in US infrastructure, economic competitiveness, and
environmental protection. I represented our team on WUFT News (a subset of PBS) and the
Engineering MAEvericks podcast, where I discussed the performance benefits of EVs and their role in
reducing the global carbon footprint. I coordinated and led STEM education events for public high school
students to visit our team’s shop and meet current members, providing up-close educational tours of our
race car’s systems and manufacturing machines. My efforts as Vice President won the Blue Origin
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Award in 2023, awarding $1,000 to our team.
