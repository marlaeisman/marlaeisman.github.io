# UF's First Electric Formula-Style Vehicle: Design, Manufacturing, and Testing (2020–2023)

**Summary:**
Led the design, simulation, and manufacturing of UF’s first electric Formula SAE racecar, focusing on high-performance powertrain and system integration.

**Technical Contributions:**
- Developed a MATLAB-based lap dynamics simulation for optimal energy distribution and regenerative braking.
- Designed a custom 400V lithium-ion powertrain and robust cooling system for safe, efficient operation.
- Managed manufacturing of 90% of vehicle components, including CNC machining and carbon fiber fabrication.
- Led 30 members to contact over 250 potential sponsors and
completely fulfill our $70,000 budget, ensuring that we could compete.
- Coordinated and led STEM education events for public high school
students to visit our team’s shop and meet current members, providing up-close educational tours of our
race car’s systems and manufacturing machines. 
## Updates
- In 2022, our vehicle achieved the fastest
acceleration in the SAE competition and ranked 3rd out of 100 teams worldwide!
- I represented our team on [WUFT News](https://www.wuft.org/sports/2023-05-03/gator-motorsports-team-transitions-to-an-electric-car-for-the-formula-sae-competition-in-june) and the
[Engineering MAEvericks podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/005-gator-motorsports-formula-team/id1646256687?i=1000599057205), where I discussed the performance benefits of EVs and their role in
reducing the global carbon footprint!
- My efforts as Vice President won the Blue Origin
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Award in 2023, awarding $1,000 to our team!
