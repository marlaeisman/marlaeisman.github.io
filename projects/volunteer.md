# Volunteer Work

### Haven Hospice
- I volunteer weekly with Haven Hospice, a local nonprofit providing care for end-of-life and nursing home residents, in the No One Dies Alone program.
- I have accrued over 30 hours with Haven in the last year!

### UF Society of Women Engineers
- I volunteer at 2+ events per semester with the UF Society of Women Engineers.
- I regularly lead and participate in creating hands-on activities for local K-8 public school visits and outreach events such as ‘Introduce A Girl To Engineering’ Day and UF’s Engineering Fair.
- One of my most successful lessons was about the Florida Aquifer, where students made a water filter out of recycled materials and soil to understand how clean water is made while engaging in a fun outdoor project.

### Habitat for Humanity
- I volunteer with Alachua County Habitat for Humanity.
- I apply engineering principles to construct affordable, safe homes for community members.
- My contributions led to recognition as a Southside Business Men’s Club Youth Achiever and earning a $20,000 scholarship.
