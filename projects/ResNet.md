# Enhanced Target Tracking Using Real-Time Residual Neural Networks (2024)

**Summary:**
Developed a custom residual neural network (ResNet) architecture for real-time quadrotor target tracking, integrating deep learning with sensor fusion for robust outdoor flight.

**Technical Contributions:**
- Designed and mathematically analyzed a novel ResNet for nonlinear control tasks.
- Implemented sensor fusion with GPS, IMU, and LiDAR using ROS 2 for real-time data integration.
- Led successful outdoor experiments, achieving stable trajectory tracking in challenging conditions.
