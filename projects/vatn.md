# AUV Autonomy: Robust Underwater Vehicle Control with Deep RL (Vatn Systems, 2025)

**Summary:**
Developed a six-degree-of-freedom model-based controller for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), integrating deep reinforcement learning for robust trajectory tracking and adaptive navigation.

**Technical Contributions:**
- Designed and simulated nonlinear AUV dynamics and control in Python.
- Implemented deep RL algorithms for adaptive policy learning in uncertain aquatic environments.
- Conducted hardware-in-the-loop sensor testing and field validation on real AUV platforms.
