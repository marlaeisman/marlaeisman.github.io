The Formula SAE racing design team, Gator Motorsports,
designs, builds, and manufactures a Formula-style race car every year.

## Updates
- In 2022, our vehicle achieved the fastest
acceleration in the SAE competition and ranked 3rd out of 100 teams worldwide!
- I represented our team on [WUFT News](https://www.wuft.org/sports/2023-05-03/gator-motorsports-team-transitions-to-an-electric-car-for-the-formula-sae-competition-in-june) and the
[Engineering MAEvericks podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/005-gator-motorsports-formula-team/id1646256687?i=1000599057205), where I discussed the performance benefits of EVs and their role in
reducing the global carbon footprint!
- My efforts as Vice President won the Blue Origin
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Award in 2023, awarding $1,000 to our team!

## Contributions
- I became Lead EV Engineer, dedicating over 40 hours per week for three years to research and
develop UF’s first-ever electric racecar.
- I designed a lap dynamics program in MATLAB to simulate the
race track with high-order dynamics including regenerative braking.
- Based on the program’s predicted
energy distribution and battery geometry, I designed a custom 400-volt lithium-ion powertrain and
robust cooling system to efficiently power the vehicle and maintain safe battery temperatures.
- I supported
the combustion team in parallel, where we personally manufactured over 90% of our vehicle components
through manual/CNC machining and carbon fiber fabrication.

- In my third year with Gator Motorsports, I led the team as Vice President after university budget
cuts eliminated 100% of our funding.
- I led 30 members to contact over 250 potential sponsors and
completely fulfill our $70,000 budget, ensuring that we could compete.
- My leadership developed the global
partnership and public engagement skills of my team members, better equipping them to enter the STEM
workforce.
- My outreach attracted media attention, where I seized the opportunity to engage the public on
STEM education and sustainable engineering solutions.
- I used my vehicle development research to
highlight the pivotal role of EV technologies in US infrastructure, economic competitiveness, and
environmental protection.
- I coordinated and led STEM education events for public high school
students to visit our team’s shop and meet current members, providing up-close educational tours of our
race car’s systems and manufacturing machines.
