I conducted an in-depth residual neural network architectural analysis to understand the effect of bias, neural depth, activation functions, and gains on system performance for double pendulum dynamics.  Based on the systemâ€™s results, I derived
original mathematical improvements to deep residual neural networks and proved the precise correspondence between the simulation and theoretical predictions.

I designed and executed a multi-agent tracking simulation complemented by an outdoor experiment, leveraging Deep Neural Networks. I implemented a residual neural network architecture for real-time target tracking in dynamic settings using IMU and GPS data through ROS 2.
