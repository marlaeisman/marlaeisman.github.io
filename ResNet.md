# Enhanced Target Tracking Using Real-Time Residual Neural Networks (2024)

- I defended my thesis successfully in November 2024!
- I presented my contributions, including my design and mathematical proof of an original residual network (ResNet) architecture and its performance improvements related to bias and activation modifications. 
- Within the project, I defined the research scope based on current limitations, wrote a Python program to evaluate neural network parameters, implemented the ResNet into the controller, and thoroughly analyzed the results. 
- I led the labâ€™s first successful outdoor experiment, integrating ROS 2 with GPS, IMU, and LiDAR data for quadrotor drones. 
- My controller used real-time deep learning to maintain stability throughout wind and uneven terrain while tracking a nonlinear trajectory.
