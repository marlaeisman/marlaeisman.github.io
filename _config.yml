  I am a MS/PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley. I research model predictive control and machine learning with the [MPC lab](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/mpc-lab). I received my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Florida (UF) in December 2024. During my undergraduate education, I was the Lead Engineer at Gator Motorsports, a researcher in UF’s Nonlinear Controls and Robotics Lab and the Cognition, Action, and Perception of Speech Lab, and completed internships at SpaceX, Tesla, and Vatn Systems. I also volunteered with the Society of Women Engineers and Haven Hospice.
