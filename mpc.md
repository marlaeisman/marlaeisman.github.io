# MPC Lab: Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning for Legged Robots (2025â€“ )

**Summary:**
PhD research focused on developing and analyzing model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning algorithms for agile legged robots (Unitree Go2W). Emphasis on robust trajectory planning, optimal feedback control, and real-world deployment in uncertain environments.

**Technical Contributions:**
- Designed and implemented MPC algorithms for nonlinear, high-dimensional robotic systems.
- Integrated reinforcement learning for adaptive control and improved performance in dynamic tasks.
- Conducted hardware experiments and simulation studies to validate theoretical results.
