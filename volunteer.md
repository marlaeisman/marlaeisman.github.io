# Volunteer Work

As the first female engineer in my family and a graduate of public schools, I am deeply motivated
to make STEM education more accessible for minority and low-income students. Having experienced
firsthand the intimidation of pursuing a field where I often felt out of place, I volunteer at least twice per
semester to encourage young girls to embrace their curiosity and creativity. As a UF Society of Women
Engineers member, I regularly lead and participate in creating hands-on activities for local K-8 public
school visits and outreach events such as ‘Introduce A Girl To Engineering’ Day and UF’s Engineering
Fair. One of my most successful lessons was about the Florida Aquifer, where students made a water filter
out of recycled materials and soil to understand how their clean water was made and get their hands dirty
in a fun outdoor project. The fulfilling experience of sharing my research and engineering skills with others
motivates me to continue promoting STEM education, inclusion, and public engagement throughout
my future career.
My volunteer work offers a profound perspective on the real-world impacts of engineering. I
volunteer with Alachua County Habitat for Humanity, applying engineering principles to construct
affordable, safe homes for community members. Contributing to the tangible benefits of technical outreach
reinforced my dedication to societal well-being and local partnerships. These outreach efforts, combined
with my academic achievement led to my recognition as a Southside Business Men’s Club Youth
Achiever and a $20,000 scholarship.
For the last year, I have volunteered weekly with Haven Hospice, a local nonprofit providing
care for end-of-life and nursing home residents, in the No One Dies Alone program. Playing music,
reading out loud, and spending time with patients led me to witness the courage and relentless spirit of those
affected by crippling neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Through my research
in nonlinear controls and autonomy, I realized that complex control systems could support the patients’
mental and physical burdens and increase their freedom and mobility. This experience deepened my resolve
to apply my work in nonlinear control theory and autonomy to support intelligent systems—such as
assistive movement technologies, adaptive prosthetics, and brain-machine interfaces—that can enhance
mobility and independence for those affected. I see my research not only advancing the field of controls
and robotics but also directly improving lives, particularly for those facing immense physical and
cognitive challenges.
